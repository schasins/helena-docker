THE HELENA DOCKER INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOW INTEGRATED INTO THE MAIN HELENA REPO https://github.com/schasins/helena.  THIS REPO IS USEFUL FOR FINDING SOME OF THE HELENA DOCKER HISTORY, BUT IT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED.  FOR UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON USING HELENA VIA DOCKER, SEE https://github.com/schasins/helena/blob/master/readme-docker.txt.
